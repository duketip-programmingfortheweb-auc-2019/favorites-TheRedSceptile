    <p class="fightertext"> Hailing from the F-Zero franchise, Captain Falcon has become more associated with Smash than
        his own franchise. He debuted in the hidden gem "F-Zero" for the SNES, a high speed racing game set in the future,
        where vehihicles are all magnet propelled like some trains today, so no friction exists with these. Because of this,
        a new sport had arose, F-Zero. Captain Falcon and his vehicle, the Blue Falcon, were one of 4 characters. However,
        he was nevere seen out of his car until Smash. Speaking of Smash, Captain Falcon is a rushdown character, running
        in at lightning speeds to get in some heavy blows on his opponet. His neutral special is the ever so iconic FALCON PUNCH!!!
        He charges up a punch, coated in fire, and punches the opponet, sending them straight to the blastzone. His side special,
        Raptor Boost, he charges at the opponet and uppercuts them, launching them upwards. His up special, Falcon Rise, 
        has him leap upwards, if he grabs the enemy, he'll send them flying and he'll be able to perform the move again.
        His down special, Falcon Kick, has him dive forward, his foot aflame, and kick the opponet.
